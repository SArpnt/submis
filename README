# submis

only works on notitg because jank

simple theme intended to streamline actually playing the game
also has anything that i want because this git repository is literally just in my nitg themes folder
title is based on the word "submissive" since the theme gets rid of in-your-face elements, annoyances, and many unneccecary features

does many things:
starts in main menu
removes some unneccecary elements that get in the way such as annoying branding
improve some menus (debatable)
improved song wheel
adds scatter plot (currently terrible)
